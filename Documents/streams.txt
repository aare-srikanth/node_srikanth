Streams :

Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. In Node.js, there are four types of streams −

Readable − Stream which is used for read operation.

Writable − Stream which is used for write operation.

Duplex − Stream which can be used for both read and write operation.

Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.


Piping Streams :

Piping is a mechanism where we provide the output of one stream as the input to another stream.


Chaining the Streams :

Chaining is a mechanism to connect the output of one stream to another stream and create a chain of multiple stream operations.
